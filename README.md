## Overview

The Neural-Covenant Protocol (NCP) is a sovereign execution-layer governance
protocol designed to enforce mandatory control over AI-generated outputs
through cryptographic pre-execution validation.

NCP establishes a binding covenant between AI systems and sovereign authority:
no AI output may be executed unless it is formally authorized, cryptographically
signed, and validated within an approved control context.
