# NCP‑X

NCP‑X is the canonical identifier of a sovereignty‑preserving AI control protocol
built on the Control Logic Core – Architecture (CLC‑A).

The system was first publicly disclosed in February 2026 under the descriptive
identifier “Neural‑Covenant Protocol (NCP)”.

To ensure long‑term legal neutrality, trademark safety, and global reference clarity,
the canonical system identifier is designated as NCP‑X.

This designation does not alter the underlying architecture, formal claims,
or intellectual ownership, all of which remain defined by the CLC‑A framework.

## Canonical Reference

The Control Logic Core – Architecture (CLC‑A) documents constitute the
authoritative technical and architectural definition of the system.

All prior references to “Neural‑Covenant Protocol (NCP)” are preserved strictly
as historical identifiers of the first public disclosure.

## Legal Notice
