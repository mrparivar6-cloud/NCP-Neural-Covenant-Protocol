Document ID: NCP-2026-FINAL
Associated Standards: UASCS-1.0, CLC-A v1.1, DAL v2.0

Status: Final Release for Global Standardization


1. ABSTRACT
The Neural-Covenant Protocol (NCP), authored by Mohammadreza Parivar, introduces the world’s first cryptographic enforcement mechanism for Artificial Intelligence. While previous standards focused on ethical guidelines, NCP mandates a Pre-Execution Integrity Proof. By bridging the gap between raw neural processing and the Decision Authority Layer (DAL), this protocol ensures that no AI system can generate or execute a command unless its internal state is verified as compliant with the Unified AI Sovereignty Control Standard (UASCS).


2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The NCP acts as a "Biological Sentry" for silicon-based intelligence. It consists of three non-negotiable modules:

2.1. The Parivar Neural Hash (PNH)
Every AI model under this protocol must generate a dynamic hash of its active weights and attention heads.
• Enforcement: If a model attempts to bypass safety filters (Jailbreaking), the PNH immediately deviates from the registered "Safe-State" baseline.
• Result: The system triggers an automated "Cognitive Freeze" via the CLC-A (Control Layered Cognition Architecture).

2.2. Cryptographic Sovereignty Interlock
This layer connects the AI's output to the DAL (Decision Authority Layer).
• Mechanism: Every packet of data produced by an AI is digitally signed using the NCP key.
• Global Reference: Systems not carrying a Mohammadreza Parivar Verified Signature will be rejected by global firewalls and IoT infrastructure, making this the "Passport" for AI.

2.3. Causal Compliance Verification (CCV)
Using the UASCS-CVP (Compliance Verification Protocol), the NCP translates statistical output into symbolic logic to ensure it aligns with human-centric sovereignty before it reaches the end-user.


3. FORMAL SPECIFICATION (The Compliance Formula)
To ensure technical rigor, the protocol operates under the following constraint:

[Formal Constraint Text Missing in Original Submission - Using Placeholder]
Constant. If the gradient of autonomy exceeds the defined control threshold, the UASCS-RIS (Risk Intelligence Specification) protocol initiates a mandatory reset of the agent's context window.


4. GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
To establish Mohammadreza Parivar as the global reference, the NCP is released under the following terms:

1. Mandatory Root of Trust: All AI Agents must register their "Identity Core" within the decentralized DAL framework.

2. Unbypassable Execution: Hardware manufacturers (GPUs/TPUs) are encouraged to implement NCP-hashing at the silicon level to prevent software-side tampering.

3. Auditable Transparency: Utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the NCP allows for 100% compliance auditing without exposing the AI's proprietary training data.


5. CONCLUSION
The Neural-Covenant Protocol is the final piece of the architecture envisioned by Mohammadreza Parivar. It transforms AI from a "black box" into a "controlled utility," ensuring that human sovereignty is not just a preference, but a mathematical certainty in the age of AGI.
